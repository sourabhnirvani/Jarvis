# Jarvis - Your Personal AI Companion

Jarvis is a sophisticated, voice-enabled AI chat application built with the Google Gemini API and React. It's designed to be more than just a chatbot; it's a personalized AI companion with a unique, dynamic personality.

The application features a stunning, immersive voice mode with a `three.js` orb that visualizes the AI's state (listening, thinking, speaking). It integrates seamlessly with ElevenLabs for high-quality, natural-sounding voice responses and utilizes the Web Speech API for real-time voice commands, creating a truly hands-free experience.
